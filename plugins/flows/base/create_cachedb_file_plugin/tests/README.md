# create_cachedb_file_plugin tests

Two layers:

- **Pure suite** — `test_chunk_planner.py`, `test_planner_properties.py`,
  `test_source_adapter_sql.py`, `test_source_adapters.py`, `test_checkpoint.py`,
  `test_fresh_copy.py`, `test_options.py`. These import only `pytest`, `duckdb`
  and `pydantic`; the modules under test never import `prefect`. Safe to run
  anywhere. `test_source_adapters.py` drives the real `collect` orchestration by
  stubbing the adapters' two statement-executing methods, so no sqlalchemy and
  no database are needed.
- **Integration** — `test_copy_integration.py`. Uses local DuckDB as both source
  and target. Slower; still no external services.
- **Structure** — `test_copy_structure.py`, with helpers in `copy_source.py`.
  `copy.py` imports prefect and cannot be imported here, so the control flow
  that has to hold in it — what a dryRun must not do, which exception clears the
  resume point — is asserted by parsing the module with `ast`. Structural
  assertions are used only where behaviour cannot be reached; anything testable
  by running it lives in a pure helper these tests call directly.

## Running

```sh
python3 -m venv /tmp/cachevenv
/tmp/cachevenv/bin/pip install pytest==9.0.3 duckdb==1.4.0 pydantic==2.10.6

cd plugins/flows/base
PYTHONPATH="$PWD:$PWD/.." /tmp/cachevenv/bin/pytest create_cachedb_file_plugin/tests/ -v
```

`PYTHONPATH` needs both `plugins/flows/base` (for the plugin package) and
`plugins/flows` (for `_shared_flow_utils`), matching the convention in
`cohort_discovery_plugin/tests/README.md`.

## Import discipline

`errors.py`, `planner_types.py`, `chunk_utils.py`, `source_stats.py` and
`checkpoint.py` must never import `prefect`. They take a `logger` argument
instead. That is what lets this suite run without the Prefect worker image.
`test_checkpoint.py::test_checkpoint_module_does_not_drag_in_prefect` and
`test_chunk_planner.py::test_planner_modules_do_not_drag_in_prefect` enforce
this at import time — for the whole `pytest` process, not just their own
module. Never add a test here that imports `prefect` (directly or via `copy.py`
/ `flow.py`); it will poison `sys.modules` and fail those two checks even
though nothing it tests actually broke the discipline. `concurrency_reconciliation.py`
genuinely needs prefect's client/schema classes to test — see
`../tests_prefect/` for that suite, run separately.
