    idempotent against itself when the two calls do not overlap. Two cache builds
    starting together both read "absent" and both POST; the loser gets 409 and, left
    unhandled, takes the whole cache flow down with it:

    The 409 is what the server sends, but it is NOT what reaches this frame:
    `create_global_concurrency_limit` translates it into `ObjectAlreadyExists`
    (prefect/client/orchestration/_concurrency_limits/client.py:373), so catching
    only `PrefectHTTPStatusError` lets the failure through untouched. Both are
    caught -- the translated form is the one seen in practice, and the raw status
    is kept for a client version that does not translate.

    Either one means the limit exists, which is the only thing this call wanted.
    Every other status still raises -- a lock that is genuinely unavailable must not
    be mistaken for one that is ready.
