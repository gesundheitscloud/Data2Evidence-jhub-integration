/**
 * Native Atlas3 single-spa entry for Patient Analytics (no iframe).
 *
 * Atlas3 loads this bundle with System.import and calls the exported
 * bootstrap/mount/unmount lifecycles directly, passing its own customProps
 * (authContext, messageBus, domElement, getToken, datasetId, locale, ...).
 * Those props differ from the portal contract src/lifecycles.ts expects:
 *
 * - qeSvcUrl is absent, which would make the vuex auth module fall back to
 *   import.meta.env.VITE_HOST (undefined in this build). Atlas3 serves the
 *   plugin same-origin, so qeSvcUrl is normalized to window.location.origin
 *   (the same value the iframe boot uses).
 * - features / featuresLoading / releaseId may be absent; default them so the
 *   portal-context store never sees undefined.
 *
 * The `alp-terminology-open` DOM event is answered here via the host's
 * messageBus instead of the iframe postMessage relay in
 * utils/atlasTerminologyBridge.ts: the host's concept set chooser is requested
 * with `conceptSet:choose` and the choice is delivered through the event's own
 * onClose, so callers are unchanged.
