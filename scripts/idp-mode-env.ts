/**
 * Decide and record the mode of an env file that does not name one yet.
 *
 * - Names a valid mode already: left exactly as it is.
 * - Names D2E_IDP_MODE with a value that is not a recognised mode (including
 *   empty): throws InvalidIdpModeError rather than silently treating the file
 *   as unstamped, which would append a conflicting D2E_IDP_MODE line on every
 *   run.
 * - Has D2E_IDP: written by an init that already targeted trex, so trex.
 * - Has Logto app credentials but no D2E_IDP: an installation from before trex,
 *   whose users are in Logto, so logto-federated, plus the settings trex needs.
 *   Either spelling of the app secret counts. Installations predating the
 *   ALP -> D2E rename carry only LOGTO__ALP_APP__CLIENT_SECRET, and those are
 *   the oldest installations of all - exactly the ones this mode exists for.
 *   docker-compose.yml resolves the pair the same way
 *   (${LOGTO__D2E_APP__CLIENT_SECRET:-${LOGTO__ALP_APP__CLIENT_SECRET}}), so
 *   reading only the new name here would call a live Logto installation a
 *   fresh one and cut its users off from their accounts.
 *   D2E__SEED_USER is deliberately not added: it would create admin@<domain>
 *   with a well-known password on an installation that already has an admin.
 * - Anything else: trex.
